# weather-app
Weather app created via PluralSight Course titled Hands-On JavaScript Project: JSON by Paul Cheney.

A weather app was created with JSON objects passed to the client-side via a WebAPI from https://openweathermap.org/.

Since AJAX request methodology was used via the XMLHttpRequest object, the server sent over the requested object as a stringified JSON object, which was then converted to a JS object by the JS Engine.  

The JS Engine updates the DOM via communicating with the Rendering Engine.  Then, the updated HTML and CSS are sent to the page without a page reload, which is a beautiful thing.
